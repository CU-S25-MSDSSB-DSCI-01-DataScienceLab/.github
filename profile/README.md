## 👋 Data Science Lab 2024 @ Constructor University Master "Data Science for Society and Business"

🙋‍♀️ This GitHub organization is the practice area for the Lab. 

It has *public* information in  
[**Syllabus and Schedule Website**](https://cu-s24-msdssb-dsci-01-datasciencelab.github.io/Website/)

and *private* information on course organization and scheduling including information about students and their projects  
[**Course-Organization**](https://github.com/CU-S24-MSDSSB-DSCI-01-DataScienceLab/Course-Organization)

Further on, the organization will provide **personalized repositories** for registered students.   
Your repos are private and only you, the instructors, and maybe other registered students can see them. 


### Become a member of the organization ⭐

**As a registered student in the courses you must be a member of this organization!**

Steps to onboard you 👣 

1. The instructor, Jan Lorenz, will invite registered students based on the GitHub names known from the first semester. *Inform Jan Lorenz when you will not use your known GitHub account, but another one.* (You have to wait until this is done. Then GitHub will send you the invitation.)
2. **You have to accept the invitation which comes with an email from GitHub**
3. Now, you can access all repositories that will be created for you in this organization!
